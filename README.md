Movie-Database
==============

This is a basic movie database - similar to that of IMDb. The main website is at index.php, which contains links to add Movies, Actors, Directors, Comments, and Relations between each. It also contains browsing functions: when an actor is searched, the result displays a link to all movies that he/she played in along with his/her respective role. When a movie is searched, all respective actors that played in the movie along with links to information about them are displayed.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design the website - though there was no emphasis placed in the layout. The main functionalities were programmed through PHP and MySQL to insert, update, delete, and maintain the database. There is pre-loaded data in the "data" directory, which contains thousands of tuples of information that can be entered into the database to start. Along with the data are .sql files that can be executed to create, load, or drop all tables using the data provided.
